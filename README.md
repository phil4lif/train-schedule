This web application requires the user to authenticate using either github or google.

Once they have done so it will load the train schedule page that will display trains and their schedule data.  Every minute the table will be updated so that the "minutes until next train" and "next train time" are correct.

I've also added a large clock to the page, so the user can easily see the current time.

A user can add any trains that they would like to see displayed in the table.  

This app uses bootstrap, jquery, momentjs and firebase.
